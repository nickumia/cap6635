A summary of the AI techniques explored in Dr. Zhu's AI class

## AI Search Techniques

### Blind Methods

- Simple Reflex Agents: Agents react to environment based on pre-programmed rules

  ex. `ReflexVacuum`
  - I will randomly choose a new location which may or may not have dirt and I may or may not have been to before
  
- Model-based Agents: Agents maintains an internal representation of the world.  Remembers it's own past actions. 

  ex. `ModelVacuum`
  - My path is preprogrammed, I will not revisit locations

- Goal-based Agents: Agents 'looks for' goal makes decisions based on a single utility function.

  ex. `GoalVacuum`
  - Where is the closest dirt?

- Utility-based Agents
